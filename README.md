# Connect 4

## Overview
I created connect 4 using the MERN stack with a high scores table that connects to a database. Players take turns selecting where their piece goes and trying to get 4 pieces in a row. When someone wins, they are prompted to input their name and it is saved into the database. The player is then transfered to the database. 

## Technologies Used
- MongoDB
- Express
- React
- Nodejs
- Javascript
- HTML, CSS

## Challenges
The goal of this project was to learn how to connect data to the database. I used fetch statements as well as props to correctly display the data in a manner that I wanted. I also learned how to sue useEffect and useStates in react. I choose to keep the css simple on this project so I could focus more time on learning the technical aspects.
